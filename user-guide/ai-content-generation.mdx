  <Step title="Be Specific in Prompts">
    Better: "Announce our new AI customer service feature that reduces response times by 80%"

    - "C-suite executives in tech"

    Match your brand personality:
    - Professional for B2B LinkedIn
    - Casual for Twitter engagement
    - Friendly for customer support
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and Edit">
    AI-generated content is a starting point:
    - Add personal touches
    - Verify facts and claims
    - Ensure brand alignment
    - Check for errors
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Different Variations">
    Generate multiple versions and A/B test:

    - Experiment with lengths
    - Test various hashtags
  </Step>
</Steps>
