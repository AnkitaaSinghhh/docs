  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "post_id": 42,
    "request_message": "Please review this product launch post"
  }'
```

## Responding to Approval Requests

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:5000/api/approvals/1/respond \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "status": "approved",
    "response_message": "Looks great! Approved for publishing."
  }'
