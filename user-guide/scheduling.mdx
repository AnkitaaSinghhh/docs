## One-Time Scheduling

Schedule a post to publish once at a specific time.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/schedules \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "post_id": 42,
    "schedule_type": "one_time",
    "scheduled_at": "2024-01-25T14:00:00Z"
  }'
```

## Recurring Scheduling

Set up posts that repeat automatically.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/schedules \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "post_id": 42,
    "schedule_type": "recurring",
    "scheduled_at": "2024-01-20T09:00:00Z",
    "recurrence_rule": {
      "frequency": "daily",
      "interval": 1,
      "end_date": "2024-02-20T09:00:00Z"
    }
  }'
```

### Recurrence Options

- **daily**: Every day
- **weekly**: Every week on specific days
- **monthly**: Specific day(s) of the month
- **custom**: Use cron expressions for advanced patterns

## Bulk Scheduling

Schedule multiple posts efficiently:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/schedules/bulk \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "posts": [
      { "post_id": 1, "scheduled_at": "2024-01-20T09:00:00Z" },
      { "post_id": 2, "scheduled_at": "2024-01-20T14:00:00Z" },
      { "post_id": 3, "scheduled_at": "2024-01-21T09:00:00Z" }
    ]
  }'
```

## Managing Schedules

### View All Schedules

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/schedules \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

## How Scheduling Works

The scheduler uses **node-cron** to automatically publish posts:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Schedule">
    You create a schedule with a `scheduled_at` time
  </Step>
  <Step title="Cron Job Monitors">
    Every minute, the scheduler checks for pending posts
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automatic Publishing">
    When `scheduled_at` time arrives, post is published to all platforms
  </Step>
  <Step title="Status Updated">
    Post status changes from `scheduled` to `published` or `failed`
  </Step>
</Steps>
